# Compact &amp; Fast MVC Framework
SimpleMVC is a straightforward PHP implementation of the MVC pattern. It has no dependencies and is easy to use.

    
## 1. Prerequisites
- A Webserver with [PHP 7.0](http://php.net) or higher and the possibility to rewrite a URL ([IIS](http://iis.net), [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), Nginx, etc)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for PSR-4 pre-loading and (if you want) package management for your project.

## 2. Download SimpleMVC
- Simply copy and paste the content of the ZIP file to your project root directory.
- Run composer update to generate the needed PSR-4 preloading files.

## 3. Setup your Webserver
In the root of each release there are 3 config files. One for IIS (web.config), Apache (.htaccess) and nginx (nginx-redirector.txt). Please use the correct file based on your setup.

## 4. Let's go!
Experiment with the default setup or check the docs for more information. Happy coding!
